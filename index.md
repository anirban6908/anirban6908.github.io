Welcome to my webpage! I'm Anirban Nandi, a computational neuroscientist by profession and electrical engineer by training. I grew up in Kolkata, India, where I completed my <!---
schooling : [Ramkrishna Mission Narendrapur](https://www.rkmvnarendrapur.org/),
--> undergraduate studies at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) before flying all the way to the U.S. to earn my Ph.D. at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). From there, I joined [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/) in Seattle as a Scientist where my work has focused on developing in-silico representations of the most fundamental component of brain circuitry: neurons. These models incorporate various data modalities and help us gain insights into the structural organization as well as network dynamics of the mammalian brain.
